# Voting Program

A decentralized, on-chain voting application built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. This program provides the core on-chain logic for a flexible voting system.

## Core Functionality

- **Poll Creation:** Any user can create a new poll for a specific topic or election.
- **Candidate Management:** Multiple candidates can be added to each poll after its creation.
- **Secure Voting:** The program ensures that each voter can only cast a single vote for any given poll, guaranteeing fair and transparent results.
