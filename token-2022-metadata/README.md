# Metadata & Metadata Pointer Extension

This project demonstrates creating a Solana NFT on the client side with an attached metadata account and a metadata pointer extension. It shows how to initialize the mint, set up metadata for token details (name, symbol, URI), and link it via the pointer extension â€” enabling flexible and upgradeable metadata management.
