# Get all tokens in a wallet

A simple client-side libray for interacting with both legacy SPL Tokens (Token) and Token-2022 (TokenExtensions) program on Solana to fetch all the tokens.

The goal of this library is to provide a single, unified API to abstract away the complexities of dealing with two different token programs. Whether you're fetching mint data or a user's token accounts, you can use one simple function.
